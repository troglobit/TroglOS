	  uftpd is a UNIX daemon with sane built-in defaults.  It just works.

	    - FTP and/or TFTP
	    - No complex configuration file
	    - Runs from standard UNIX inetd, or standalone
	    - Uses $HOME from ftp user in /etc/passwd, or custom path
	    - Uses ftp/tcp and tftp/udp from /etc/services, or custom ports
	    - Privilege separation, drops root privileges having bound to ports
	    - Possible to use symlinks outside of the FTP home directory
	    - Possible to have group writable FTP home directory
