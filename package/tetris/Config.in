	  One of the smallest Tetris implementations in the world!

	  Utilizing only ANSI escape sequences to draw the board, no external
          library dependencies other than a standard C library, like uClibc or
          musl libc. Hence, very suitable for embedded devices in need of an
          easter egg ;-)
