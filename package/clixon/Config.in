	  Clixon is a YANG-based configuration manager, with interactive
	  CLI, NETCONF and RESTCONF interfaces, an embedded database and
	  transaction mechanism.

          Clixon has support for RESTCONF over HTTP/2 using NGHTTP2 as
	  well as support for FCGI using NGINX (HTTP/1), or the native
	  support for HTTP/1.

	  If Net-SNMP is enabled, it is possible to also enable the Clixon
	  YANG mapping to SNMP.

	  NOTE: Clixon by itself does not do anything, you need to build an
	        application it can run.  See the example for more info.
