config BR2_PACKAGE_MDNSD
	bool "mdnsd"
	help
	  Small mDNS-SD daemon for advertising services and device discovery,
	  similar to Avahi and Bonjour.

	  By default, mdnsd runs on all interfaces that support multicast.
	  It reads services to announce from /etc/mdns.d/*.service, a few
	  common services are included below.  To override the defaults,
	  e.g., path to services, TTL of multicast frames, or the default
	  interface, set MDNSD_ARGS in /etc/default/mdnsd

	  Note: currently no NSS integration with GLIBC.
