config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_INITCTL_GROUP
	string "Group for /run/finit/socket"
	default "wheel"
	help
	  On systems with multiple administrators, set the group
	  to their shared UNIX group, usually "wheel", to allow
	  them to start/stop services and reboot the system.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_KEVENTD
	bool "finit-keventd"
	default n
	help
	  Build bundled finit-keventd, which monitors kernel events
	  for AC power status and generates sys/pwr/fail condition.
	  This is a new feature in Finit v4.1 and is still very much
	  in an experimental state.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_WATCHDOG
	bool "finit-watchdogd"
	default n
	help
	  Build bundled finit-watchdogd, which provides a simplistic
	  watchdog daemon that runs in the background, kicking the
	  systemd default /dev/watchdog to prevent reboot.  This is
	  useful in very small systems where its grownup old cousin
	  watchdogd cannot be used.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

if BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_WATCHDOG

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_WATCHDOG_DEV
	string "watchdog device"
	default "/dev/watchdog"
	help
	  Device node to use for finit-watchdogd.  The default is
	  usually sufficient, but some systems have more than one.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_HOTPLUG
	bool "hotplug plugin (mdev/udev)"
	help
	  By default, Finit builds and launches its hotplug plugin.
	  It is responsible for detecting and starting the mdev tool,
	  or udevd daemon.  The former exists in many BusyBox based
	  systems and is called for "cold plugging".  The latter has
	  many various incarnations and is mostly used for desktop
	  systems.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_MODULES_LOAD
	bool "Scan /etc/modules-load.d"
	help
	  Scans /etc/modules-load.d for modules to load.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_MODPROBE
	bool "Coldplug modules using modalias magic"
	help
	  Coldplug modules using modalias magic.  Everything is
	  handled automatically based on device trees and their
	  matching kernel modules.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_RTC
	bool "RTC plugin"
	help
	  By default, Finit builds and launches its RTC plugin.  It is
	  responsible for restoring the system clock from the RTC clock
	  at boot, and saving the system clock to RTC at reboot.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_TTY
	bool "TTY plugin"
	help
	  Automatically resart tty services that are plugged in.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.

config BR2_PACKAGE_FINIT_PLUGIN_URANDOM
	bool "/dev/urandom plugin"
	help
	  By default, Finit builds and launches its urandom plugin.  It
	  is responsible for seeding /dev/urandom from a previously saved
	  seed at boot, and saving a seed at reboot.

	  For lxc/docker application builds you do not need this.
